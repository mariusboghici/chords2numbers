This repo is supposed to be a code to auto transcribe chords (manual input) of a song from the standard notation (chord names) to roman numerals based on scale degree 
for all 12 keys major or minor. 
I input the base Key of the song (C major, Ab minor, F# major, Bb minor...etc).

e.g:
In the key of C major: Dm G C became: ii V I
In the key of G major: G C D became: I IV V
In the key of A minor: Am B° C Dm Em F G became: i ii° III iv v VI VII
...etc.

The prompt:
Enter Key name: (e.g. F major or D minor or G# minor or....)
Enter chords: (input the chords of the song)


                 A little bit of music theory
                 
The triads built on each Major scale degree follow a distinct pattern. 
The roman numeral analysis is shown in parentheses.

1st: Major triad (I)
2nd: minor triad (ii)
3rd: minor triad (iii)
4th: Major triad (IV)
5th: Major triad (V)
6th: minor triad (vi)
7th: diminished triad (vii°)

Every major key has a relative minor, which starts on the 6th scale degree or step, 
so: 
The Major key is: I ii iii IV V vi vii° and 
The Minor key is: i ii° III iv v VI VII.
